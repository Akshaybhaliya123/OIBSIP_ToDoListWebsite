# OIBSIP_ToDoListWebsite
This is a basic to-do app that enables a user to add daily tasks. The to-do web app must allow users to add new items to a list, and items added to a list must be visible. Also, a user can mark a task "complete" upon its successful completion, and these completed tasks must appear on a separate list say completed tasks. In such a case, the to-do list will be a union of the pending tasks list and the completed tasks list.Irrespective of the list, a user must be able to delete or edit tasks from it.
